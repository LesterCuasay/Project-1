## __UX & Design__

## __Initial Concept__
___
I hope to deliever a website that is eye catching for the user with little to no distractions with the background or out of placed imagery/text. The site also needs to be easily navigated whether be on desktop, tablet or mobile devices.

### Wireframes
___
As part of the planning stage, I created wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). This allowed me to have a general idea how i wanted to layout my website.

Though throughout the making of the website the design slightly changed due to feedback from others to make the website look more appealing.

![home](assets/docs/home-wireframes.png "home")
- The layout for the homepage and workout page is the same to make it easier for users to navigate through the website. Though there is clear indication which page they are on.

![gallery](assets/docs/gallery-wireframes.png "gallery")
 - The layout for the gallery page, I had to change the layout in the actual website as the images were being warped in different dimensions so i decided to use flex.

 ![contact-us](assets/docs/contact-us-wireframes.png "contact-us")
 - The layout for the contact page, the thank-you page also runs the same layout though without the form in the middle. Instead it is the results from the information submitted.

### Colour Scheme
___
![colourscheme](assets/docs/colour-scheme.png "colour scheme")

I used [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to choose my colour scheme.

The background I have chosen for the wbeiste is #929aa0 which is Spanish Grey. The text for the whole website is #131112 which is Smoky Black to get with the Spanish Grey Background.

Although for the main content area i used #f4813e which is Mango Tango for the background for the boxes to give it a more appealing style.

### Typography
___

For the website, I am using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). 
I decided to use Quicksand for the heading text of the website and Kanit for the body text.

For the font pairings I used [Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/)
