## __Objective__
In this project I intent to create a website containing basic information why physical activity can benefit your lifestyle.

The main objective of this project is to make a website solely on HTML and CSS. Also to make the site responsive between different devices.

### __Goals__
The goal of this website is to encourage the users to take up physical activity.

- A well designed front page with brief sentences to engage users.
- A page containing information abotu different workouts
- A gallery showing other people in the gym and also a motivation video.
- A contact form, where a user can pass on feedback.

## __UX & Design__

### User Stories

 - As a first time user, I want to be able to easily navigate the site on different devices i.e mobile tablet etc.
 - As a returning user, I want to be able to get to the top of the page with ease.
 - As a user, I want to find out different benefits of physical activity.
 - As a user, I want to be able to get in contact and provide feedback.

***
## __Initial Concept__
I hope to deliever a website that is eye catching for the user with little to no distractions with the background or out of placed imagery/text. The site also needs to be easily navigated whether be on desktop, tablet or mobile devices.

### Wireframes
As part of the planning stage, I created wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). This allowed me to have a general idea how i wanted to layout my website.

Though throughout the making of the website the design slightly changed due to feedback from others to make the website look more appealing.

![home](assets/docs/home-wireframes.png "home")
- The layout for the homepage and workout page is the same to make it easier for users to navigate through the website. Though there is clear indication which page they are on.

![gallery](assets/docs/gallery-wireframes.png "gallery")
 - The layout for the gallery page, I had to change the layout in the actual website as the images were being warped in different dimensions so i decided to use flex.

 ![contact-us](assets/docs/contact-us-wireframes.png "contact-us")
 - The layout for the contact page, the thank-you page also runs the same layout though without the form in the middle. Instead it is the results from the information submitted.

### Colour Scheme
![colourscheme](assets/docs/colour-scheme.png "colour scheme")

I used [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to choose my colour scheme.

The background I have chosen for the wbeiste is #929aa0 which is Spanish Grey. The text for the whole website is #131112 which is Smoky Black to get with the Spanish Grey Background.

Although for the main content area i used #f4813e which is Mango Tango for the background for the boxes to give it a more appealing style.

### Typography

For the website, I am using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). 
I decided to use Quicksand for the heading text of the website and Kanit for the body text.

For the font pairings I used [Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/)

### Logo and Navigation Bar

- The main image appears on the hompage and workout page, each page will display corresponding text which page they are so it will be easier for the user to know what page they are on. This image is also responsive along with the text in the middle for different screen sizes.
